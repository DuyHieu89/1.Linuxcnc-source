There are two configuration examples, metric and imperial. Their ini files are commented for the additions for the plasmac component.

Also included are gladevcp with accompanying python files to make full use of the plasmac component.

The python folder is for remapping of the F word.

The test folder holds a glade test panel plus python code for simulation.
