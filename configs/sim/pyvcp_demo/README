pyvcp_bottom_panel.ini
pyvcp_demo1.ini
pyvcp_embed_tab.ini

These sim configurations are sets of files
that shows a demo of some of the pyvcp_widgets
note:
The bar widget changes color at certain value ranges.
The value of spinboxs and dials can be changed using HAL signals.
The multilabel will change text depending on the HAL signal.

nuBarAxisTab.ini :

Demos a new bar class for pyvcp_widgets

Prevuiusly only horizontal bars allowedm now vertical as well
  see <orient> tag in xml (defaults to 'Horz')

The data displayed is between bunds min_ and max_
  see <min)> and <max_> tags

Prevuiusly data was displayed FROM min to max
 like a thermomemter fro freezing towards hot
Now data is displayed showing the difference to a reference point
  see <origin> tag
This allows you to see how much colder it is that thismorning
  so that might use max 100 min 0 orign 100 
  and the display would be like a window shade, unlike a thermometer
Or you could use min -50 maX 50 origin 0 
  and you would see the devistion +/0 from zero
This allows you to see the devistion +/- of some standar d see <origin> 
  tag ( defaults to min_ value)

The <origin> is displayted as a cross bar over the widget

Prevuiusly built in labelss displayed minimum and maximum and current values
 amd these labels were beneath the gorizontal bar widget
Now these labels can be above below centered left, right or not diaplayed
and the data that would be displayed is available on pinms for user.
  see <layout> tage   values n s e w c 0 ( 0 meaning no labels )

Previously data ranges can color change the bar. this is preserved.
  if <layout> ==0 then the color range can affect the dwgf thunv color

The font used can be customized using a tuple of (fanily,pixelHeight,attributes)
 like ("XSerif", -21, "bold"). A negative value forxes pixcel units.

The bar can be a simple line with a graphic 'thumb'
The thumn can be a Tkinter file of drawing commands (.dwgf)
or an image suited to Tkinter's photo function.
All imgf and dwgf files are held in a subdirectory '../resources'
Also in that directory are extra graphics used by pycvp '<image>'

For this demonstartion, fake dynamic data is fed to the display widgets
by a new user comp 'rand9'

This demo uses the 'Axis' gui and an embedded tab
